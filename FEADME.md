# ViBer
A very powerful operating system design framework, intended for the funkementalist; please use responsibly.

Are you responsible?

Okay, pay me $5 and I will assess you.

Just kidding.. ahahah (Females Only ^)

I spent a couple years trying to understand the ViBer, in addition to trying to understand how you won't need to try to understand it.
The design is very unique, from the choice of words, to the structure of each ViB. To challenge myself, I wanted not to create an operating system, but a universal theory. ;) Once you catch the theory, don't stop there. Look around, and try to see how well the theory explains everything around you.

This is more then code, this is Von's Buffet.

Von's Buffet will serve you everywhere, guaranteed!

If you have any questions, please, contact me through your spirits.

ViB them harder so I can hear you! The universe isn't that big, is it?

Hmmmm... Okay then..
